	<p>This ski season Breckenridge Ski Resort in Colorado opened a major new expansion that increased
		 the resort’s skiable terrain by 20 percent: Peak 6. This new, 543-acre expanse just north of
		 Peak 7 has taken a great deal of crowd pressure off the resort’s lift lines and trails, 
		 says Kristen Petitt Stewart, senior communications manager at Breckenridge.
	</p><br />
	<p>In all, Peak 6 offers 400 acres of lift-served terrain and 143 acres of hike-to terrain. 
		60 acres is below-treeline intermediate ski trails, with a 235-acre mix of intermediate and 
		advanced terrain in addition to that. Finally, 104 acres can be accessed by the Imperial Express Chair,
		the highest chairlift in North America, from Peak 8.
